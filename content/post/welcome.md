> so, I decided to create a blog.

## What will this blog be about?

Probably a tech stuff, like how to do something with Docker, Problem troubleshooting journeys or what I like about some self-hosted apps.

## Who are you?

I'm a Furry, Photographer, Coder and Self-Hosting Enthusiast.

I Like to do stuff, but most of it are kinda stupid.

As of now, I know NextJS (but kinda on base level), Python (and python frameworks like: Flask, Django and FastAPI), how to work with docker on linux server, some knowledge about DNS and reverse-proxies.
